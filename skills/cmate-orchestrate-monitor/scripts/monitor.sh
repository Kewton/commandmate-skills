#!/usr/bin/env bash
# monitor.sh — supervise one or more orchestrate workers with the tested
# decision core (classify-state.sh / verify-completion.sh).
#
# This is the operator entrypoint. The per-poll classification and the
# completion decision live in separate, unit-tested scripts; this file only
# owns the loop, the cross-poll state, and the interventions. It is checked by
# `bash -n` in the test suite and written for bash 3.2 (macOS /bin/bash):
#   - no associative arrays: per-worker state is held in integer-indexed
#     parallel arrays and in temp files under $STATE_DIR
#   - loop variables are never named `path` (that special-var name clobbers PATH
#     under zsh/bash and breaks curl/tmux lookups; feedback_zsh_path_loop_var)
#
# Interventions, in order of how much damage a false positive does:
#   PROMPT      -> Enter (silent auto-approve, counted)
#   RATE_LIMIT  -> "a" immediately, never sleep through a limit
#   IDLE + terminal API error at the idle threshold -> resend --resend-message,
#               capped by --max-resends. This is the only recovery from the CLI
#               exhausting its own retries (Issue #1522): a live backoff is
#               classified GENERATING and must NOT be touched, because input sent
#               mid-backoff is queued and then delivered after the retry succeeds.
#
# Every one of them goes through send_to_pane(), which resolves the session from
# the poll that was just classified, verifies it exists, and reports a failed
# delivery instead of swallowing it. Every log line and every counter therefore
# describes what was DELIVERED rather than what was attempted (Issue #1602 — see
# monitor-lib.sh § "tmux session targeting" for what the old
# `2>/dev/null || true` hid).
#
# Usage:
#   monitor.sh [--interval 20] [--idle-threshold 8] [--session-prefix <prefix>] \
#              [--resend-message continue] [--max-resends 2] [--max-polls 0] \
#              [--verbose] [--hooks <file>] \
#              <worktree-id>[@<instance-id>] [<worktree-id>[@<instance-id>] ...]
#
#   <worktree-id>[@<instance-id>]
#                  the worker to watch, optionally a named agent instance
#                  (`w1@codex-2`, `w1@claude`). The instance selects BOTH the pane
#                  that is polled (`capture --agent <tool> --instance <id>`) and
#                  the pane an intervention is typed into, so classification and
#                  intervention can never drift onto different sessions. The same
#                  worktree may be listed more than once with different instances;
#                  per-worker state and log lines are keyed by `<id>@<instance>`.
#
#   --session-prefix <p>
#                  LEGACY escape hatch. Session names are derived from the capture
#                  payload's cliToolId by default (`mcbd-<cliToolId>-<worktree-id>`),
#                  which is what makes a heterogeneous fleet work without any flag.
#                  Passing this replaces the derived `mcbd-<cliToolId>` head with
#                  <p>; the instance suffix is still appended. Only needed for a
#                  session this tool did not create.
#
#   --max-polls N  stop after N poll rounds and exit 0 even if workers are still
#                  working; 0 (default) keeps polling until every worker is
#                  COMPLETE, i.e. the operator behaviour is unchanged. A bounded
#                  run ends on its own instead of having to be killed from the
#                  outside, which is what lets the loop be tested deterministically
#                  (Issue #1527) and doubles as a one-shot `--max-polls 1` probe.
#                  It only adds a stop condition — no state or intervention rule
#                  looks at it.
#
#   --verbose      emit one fixed-format line per poll per worker (see POLL_LINE
#                  below). Opt-in on purpose: the default output stays byte-identical
#                  so an operator reading the stream still sees only interventions
#                  and terminal verdicts (Issue #1533).
#
#   --hooks <file> source <file> after the built-in count_commits /
#                  count_uncommitted / read_task_status stubs, so an operator can
#                  supply the real data sources (Issue #1533, #1589). Repeatable,
#                  sourced left to right; giving it at all replaces MONITOR_HOOKS.
#                  Without it the counters return 0 and the task status is empty,
#                  which is what keeps the loop runnable standalone — and also what
#                  makes COMPLETE unreachable, since verify-completion.sh treats
#                  commits=0 && uncommitted=0 as the signature of an unstarted task.
#                  See hooks-git.sh (work counters) and hooks-task.sh (contract
#                  status) for ready-to-use implementations.

#   MONITOR_HOOKS  — default for --hooks (the flag wins when both are given).
