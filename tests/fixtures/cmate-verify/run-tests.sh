# cmate-verify — fixture-based test suite for verify-run.sh.
#
# Lives in the repository, not in the package (Issue #69): the distributed
# artifact is `skills/cmate-verify/` only, and this suite is run by CI — the
# `verify-selftest` gate in `.commandmate/verify.yaml` and the `runner-suites`
# job in `.github/workflows/validate.yml`.
#
# Still bash + git only, with no vitest and no Node: the runner under test has
# exactly those dependencies, so its suite must not add more.
#
# Output is TAP-ish (`ok - ...` / `not ok - ...`) plus a final
# `# tests: N passed, M failed`. Exit 0 only when M is 0 and enough assertions ran.
#
# bash 3.2 compatible: no `declare -A`, no `mapfile`, no `${var,,}`.

# --- 23. the run directory outlives the run (Issue #228) ---------------------
# The defect this pins: a gate that finishes before the runner has forked its
# timeout watchdog makes `wait` return at once, so the `kill` that stops that
# watchdog lands in the window where the freshly forked child still carries this
# shell's EXIT trap AND bash's own terminating-signal handler. The child then ran
# `rm -rf "$WORKDIR"` mid-run, and every later gate reported `no output captured`
# with exit 1 — a verdict on nothing, in a runner whose whole job is adjudication.
# It was probabilistic (measured ~1% per gate on Linux/ARM64), which is why the
# case is many fast gates repeated: one green run is not evidence.
#
# Bounded on purpose. 48 gates x 12 runs is what turned the pre-fix runner red in
# 20 of 20 measured repetitions; a smaller case was red in only 15 of 20, and a
# regression test that misses one time in four is how this comes back silently.
