# hooks-git.sh — reference completion hooks for monitor.sh (Issue #1533).
#
# monitor.sh ships `count_commits` / `count_uncommitted` as stubs returning 0 so
# the loop runs standalone. That also makes COMPLETE unreachable, because
# verify-completion.sh reads `commits=0 && uncommitted=0` as the signature of a
# task that was never sent. Source this file to wire both counters to the real
# checkouts:
#
#   monitor.sh --hooks <skill-dir>/scripts/hooks-git.sh <id>...
#   MONITOR_HOOKS=.../hooks-git.sh monitor.sh <id>...
#
# Env:
#   MONITOR_HOOKS_BASE     base ref commits are counted against (default origin/develop)
#   MONITOR_HOOKS_REPO     repo whose `git worktree list` is searched (default .)
#   MONITOR_WORKTREE_ROOT  directory holding checkouts named exactly after the
#                          worktree-id; tried before the git search
#
# bash 3.2 compatible and sourced into monitor.sh's shell under `set -u`, so every
# local is prefixed `mh__` and no loop variable is named `path`
# (feedback_zsh_path_loop_var_clobbers_path).
