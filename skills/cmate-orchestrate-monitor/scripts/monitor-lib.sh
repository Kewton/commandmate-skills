# --- text normalization -------------------------------------------------------
# Every text anchor below matches against normalized text, never against the raw
# JSON. Issue #1522: `↓ [0-9]` was grepped straight out of the --json file and so
# NEVER fired in production — the live TUI writes the arrow, then a colour reset,
# then the count:
#   'Sublimating… \u001b[38;5;246m(4m 25s · ↓\u001b[39m \u001b[38;5;246m14.9k tokens'
# so no digit follows "↓ ". The fixtures shipped with the first version of this
# skill were hand-written with the ANSI already stripped, which is why the unit
# tests were green while every real worker was classified IDLE. The fixtures are
# now raw captures (ANSI intact) and normalization happens here instead.
#
# Two normalizations, both from observed live payloads:
#   1. CSI sequences, in the JSON-escaped form (`\u001b[38;5;246m`, which is what
#      JSON.stringify emits) and in the raw-ESC form (a capture piped as text).
#   2. The non-breaking space the TUI puts between a marker and its payload
#      (`❯\xa0`, `⎿ \xa0Tip:` — both present in the real captures). Left alone it
#      defeats `❯ [0-9]+\.` for exactly the same reason ANSI defeated `↓ [0-9]`.
# LC_ALL=C keeps sed byte-oriented: a pane capture can carry a half-written
# multibyte glyph, and BSD sed aborts with "illegal byte sequence" on those in a
# UTF-8 locale.

# two healthy generating workers on its very first iteration. One queued the `a`,
# the other had it delivered into the conversation.

# --- prompt approval policy (Issue #59) ---------------------------------------
# Enter is not a neutral "unblock". Two facts, both measured, decide whether it
# may be typed at all:
#
#   1. It goes into the pane directly, so it overrides whatever the SERVER
#      decided. When a contract declares `autoYes.mode: off` or `denyPatterns`,
#      CommandMate withholds the answer on purpose (#1547) and publishes that it
#      did — `autoYes.lastSuppression` (#1684). Typing Enter there re-approves
#      exactly what the contract author asked to escalate.
#   2. On a multiple_choice prompt Enter confirms the DEFAULT option (#1681),
#      not "yes". That is only an approval when the default IS an approval.
#
# Measured against live `capture --json` frames (2026-08-05, CommandMate 0.21.2,
# 6 worktrees, 30 frames carrying promptData; see references/evidence.md § 1e):
#   - promptData.type was `multiple_choice` on 30/30 frames. Claude Code's plain
#     permission prompt is multiple_choice too, so "hold every multiple_choice"
#     would hold 100% of real approvals — it is not a usable discriminator.
#   - options[].isDefault existed on every frame and exactly one option carried
#     it; its label was "Yes" (number 1) on 34/34 options.
#   - the dangerous shape is visible in the SAME field: the AskUserQuestion-style
#     picker recorded for prompt db9f9d48 (`capture --prompts --json`) carries
#     three prose options and NO isDefault at all, so Enter there confirms
#     whatever the cursor happens to sit on.
#   - autoYes.lastSuppression was present on every frame (null throughout, since
#     no contract policy withheld anything during the window).
#
# Hence the rule is a positive test, not a deny-list: Enter is sent only when the
# poll shows a binary approval whose default is affirmative. Anything else — a
# policy suppression, no promptData, no default option, a non-affirmative default
# — is held and reported. Holding stalls a worker; approving the wrong option
# cannot be undone.

# --- tmux session targeting ---------------------------------------------------
# The pane an intervention is typed into is DERIVED from the capture payload, not
# guessed from a fixed prefix.
#
# Issue #1602 (CommandMate #1601, same defect, same line structure): monitor.sh
# shipped with `SESSION_PREFIX="cm"`, so every `tmux send-keys -t cm-<worktree-id>`
# addressed a session that has never existed — `tmux ls` on a CommandMate host has
# no `cm-` session at all. Each call ended in `2>/dev/null || true`, so the miss was
# invisible: the loop printed "sending 'a'" *before* sending and counted approvals
# it had never delivered. Every intervention this skill exists to perform was a
# no-op, and the log said it had worked.
#
# A fixed prefix cannot be made right by changing its default either. The real
# name is built per CLI tool and per instance:
#   mcbd-<cliToolId>-<worktreeId>[-<instance suffix>]
# (BaseCLITool.getSessionName, src/lib/cli-tools/base.ts; the claude path in
# src/lib/session/claude-session.ts is the same shape), so a single prefix can
# address neither a fleet running claude and codex nor a `--instance codex-2`
# worker.
#
# `cliToolId` is a top-level field of the capture payload (CurrentOutputPayload in
# src/lib/session/current-output-builder.ts) — the tool the SERVER resolved for
# this very poll. Deriving from it is what makes the pane we type into provably
# the pane we classified.

# The product's CLI tool ids (CLI_TOOL_IDS, src/lib/cli-tools/types.ts, measured
# 2026-08-01). A plain space-separated string because bash 3.2 has no arrays worth
# the trouble here. A drifted list silently stops resolving the agent of a
# `<worktree-id>@<instance-id>` spec, which puts the *capture* on the wrong pane —
# the same class of silent miss as #1602 itself, so run_tests.sh pins the list.
