# hooks-git.sh — reference completion hooks for monitor.sh (Issue #1533).
#
# monitor.sh ships `count_commits` / `count_uncommitted` as stubs returning 0 so
# the loop runs standalone. That also makes COMPLETE unreachable, because
# verify-completion.sh reads `commits=0 && uncommitted=0` as the signature of a
# task that was never sent. Source this file to wire both counters to the real
# checkouts:
#
#   monitor.sh --hooks <skill-dir>/scripts/hooks-git.sh <id>...
#   MONITOR_HOOKS=.../hooks-git.sh monitor.sh <id>...
#
# Every git call is checked (CommandMate #1614). A counter that could not be measured
# still answers 0 — that is the value verify-completion.sh reads on the safe
# side, since `commits=0 && uncommitted=0` can only produce NOT_STARTED or
# WORKING, never a false COMPLETE — but it is never a *silent* 0 any more: each
# cause prints one line per worker naming the command that failed, so "git could
# not answer" and "the worker did nothing" are distinguishable in the log.
# Before this, `git ... | wc -l` handed the pipeline's exit code to `wc`, so a
# failing git was indistinguishable from a worker that had written nothing.
#
# Those diagnostics carry an `ERROR` / `WARN` token (CommandMate #1728) so they
# survive the `grep -Ei "…|ERROR|FAIL"` an operator pipes the monitor through; the
# level-less `monitor hooks: …` they used to start with did not, and the one
# report that says "these zeros are not measurements" was the easiest line in the
# stream to lose.
#
# Env:
#   MONITOR_HOOKS_BASE       base ref commits are counted against (default origin/develop)
#   MONITOR_HOOKS_REPO       repo whose `git worktree list` is searched (default .)
#   MONITOR_WORKTREE_ROOT    directory holding checkouts named exactly after the
#                            worktree-id; tried before the git search. Only an
#                            escape hatch since CommandMate #1728 — the git search
#                            resolves directory-named ids on its own now — but
#                            still the answer for a checkout outside
#                            `git worktree list` or an id disambiguated with a
#                            path digest.
#   MONITOR_HOOKS_STATE_DIR  where the once-per-worker warning markers are kept
#                            (default: monitor.sh's STATE_DIR when sourced by it)
#
# bash 3.2 compatible and sourced into monitor.sh's shell under `set -u`, so every
# local is prefixed `mh__` and no loop variable is named `path`

# Warning markers live in a directory, not in a shell variable: monitor.sh calls
# the counters through `$(...)`, i.e. in a subshell, so anything assigned in here
# is discarded before the next poll and a variable-based guard would reprint the
# same line every interval. A file survives the subshell. `$$` is the sourcing
# shell's pid (bash 3.2 does not update it inside `$(...)`), so standalone use is
# stable too; when monitor.sh sources this file its own STATE_DIR is used and the
# markers are removed with it on exit.

#
# Same granularity as the base-ref warning at the bottom of this file: one line
# per worker per cause, on stderr. Per-poll would be worse than silence — at a
# 20s interval it buries the stream it is supposed to make readable, and the
# cause does not change between polls. The key is `<worktree-id>.<cause>`, so two
# different failures on one worker are both reported and the same failure on two
# workers is reported for each. If the marker cannot be written the line repeats;
# loud is the correct degradation here.
#
# <level> is `ERROR` or `WARN`, and it is in the line for one reason: to survive
# the operator's filter (CommandMate #1728). The old prefix was `monitor hooks: …`
# with no level token at all, so the standard supervision pipe —
#   monitor.sh ... 2>&1 | grep -Ei "STALL|IDLE|...|ERROR|FAIL"
# — swallowed every one of these lines. "Nothing could be measured" was then
# indistinguishable from "the workers are quiet", which is the exact silent-0
# failure mode CommandMate #1614 was opened for, arriving through its own warning
# channel.
#
#   ERROR — nothing at all could be measured for this worker: BOTH counters are
#           0 for want of an answer, so the STARTED guard in verify-completion.sh
#           is reading fabricated evidence.
#   WARN  — one counter degraded and the other still answers, so the guard keeps
#           a real signal.

#
# No CLI endpoint returns a path for a worktree-id (WorktreeItem has no `path`
# field), so it is reconstructed from `git worktree list --porcelain`, whose
# records are
#   worktree <abs path>

# THREE id schemes are matched, in this order (CommandMate #1728):
#
#   1. slug(basename(<abs path>))   — the DIRECTORY-derived scheme, and the only
#      one CommandMate mints ids with today: `deriveWorktreeId()` in
#      src/lib/git/worktree-id.ts is `sanitize(basename(resolvedPath))`, computed
#      once at first registration so an id survives every branch switch.
#   2. slug("<repo>-<branch>")      — the retired branch-derived scheme
#   3. slug("<branch>")               (`generateWorktreeId()` in worktrees.ts).
#
# Scheme 1 is the whole point of this function and it was missing: with only 2
# and 3, a repository that names worktree directories after issues rather than
# after branches resolved NOTHING — not one worker, not even the main worktree —
# and every poll answered `commits=0 uncommitted=0` for workers that had already
# committed. That is CommandMate #1614's silent floor of 0 reached by a different
# road: git succeeds, the match fails. `<repo>` is the main worktree's directory
# name, which is the first record git prints, so 2 depends on parse order and 1
# does not; 1 also works for a detached HEAD, which has no `branch` line at all.
#
# Directory first, branch second: a directory-derived id is what a live server
# hands out, so when both schemes hit (different worktrees, same slug) the live
# one must win rather than whichever record git happened to print last.
