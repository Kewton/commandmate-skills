#
# Sources, in the order they are consulted (Issue #1589, and kept byte-for-byte
# in step with CommandMate #1581 — design principle "demote string parsing"):
#
#   1. the live pane state — a worker that is visibly generating/prompting is
#      not done, whatever any record says;
#   2. `--task-status`: the terminal status the server recorded for the
#      worktree's newest execution contract. This is the *primary* completion
#      source when the delegation used `send --contract`, because that status is
#      written after the verification gates ran — it is an adjudicated verdict,
#      not an inference;
#   3. the capture-derived heuristics below (STARTED guard + idle streak + work
#      counters), which are the fallback for contract-less delegation, for
#      CommandMate versions with no task ledger, and for tasks that have not
#      reached a terminal status yet.
#
# The STARTED guard exists because worker monitoring once reported an *unstarted*
# session as COMPLETE (feedback_orchestrate_monitor_started_guard): `commandmate
# send` left the task text in the composer with Enter unconfirmed, the worker
# never generated, the idle streak climbed, and a guard without this check
# emitted `COMPLETE commits=0 uncommitted=0`. Rules:
#   - `--started` is 1 only after a generation anchor was observed at least once.
#   - `commits=0 && uncommitted=0` is the signature of an unsent task, not a
#     finished one: a worker that did anything leaves at least uncommitted changes.
#
# Demoting the heuristics does not delete them. Every guard above stayed exactly
# where it was; the task ledger was added *in front* of them, and it only ever
# speaks when it has a terminal ruling.
