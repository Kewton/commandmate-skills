# --- text normalization -------------------------------------------------------
# Every text anchor below matches against normalized text, never against the raw
# JSON. Issue #1522: `↓ [0-9]` was grepped straight out of the --json file and so
# NEVER fired in production — the live TUI writes the arrow, then a colour reset,
# then the count:
#   'Sublimating… \u001b[38;5;246m(4m 25s · ↓\u001b[39m \u001b[38;5;246m14.9k tokens'
# so no digit follows "↓ ". The fixtures shipped with the first version of this
# skill were hand-written with the ANSI already stripped, which is why the unit
# tests were green while every real worker was classified IDLE. The fixtures are
# now raw captures (ANSI intact) and normalization happens here instead.
#
# Two normalizations, both from observed live payloads:
#   1. CSI sequences, in the JSON-escaped form (`\u001b[38;5;246m`, which is what
#      JSON.stringify emits) and in the raw-ESC form (a capture piped as text).
#   2. The non-breaking space the TUI puts between a marker and its payload
#      (`❯\xa0`, `⎿ \xa0Tip:` — both present in the real captures). Left alone it
#      defeats `❯ [0-9]+\.` for exactly the same reason ANSI defeated `↓ [0-9]`.
# LC_ALL=C keeps sed byte-oriented: a pane capture can carry a half-written
# multibyte glyph, and BSD sed aborts with "illegal byte sequence" on those in a
# UTF-8 locale.

# task text contained the identifier `ml_has_rate_limit`, the old bare
# `rate.?limit` anchor matched it, and the loop fired `tmux send-keys a Enter` at
# two healthy generating workers on its very first iteration. One queued the `a`,
# the other had it delivered into the conversation.
# The same scoping protects the *live* anchors from the mirror-image failure: a
# spinner line (`↓ 14.9k tokens`, `esc to interrupt`) that scrolled into history

# --- tmux session targeting ---------------------------------------------------
# The pane an intervention is typed into is DERIVED from the capture payload, not
# guessed from a fixed prefix.
#
# Issue #1602 (CommandMate #1601, same defect, same line structure): monitor.sh
# shipped with `SESSION_PREFIX="cm"`, so every `tmux send-keys -t cm-<worktree-id>`
# addressed a session that has never existed — `tmux ls` on a CommandMate host has
# no `cm-` session at all. Each call ended in `2>/dev/null || true`, so the miss was
# invisible: the loop printed "sending 'a'" *before* sending and counted approvals
# it had never delivered. Every intervention this skill exists to perform was a
# no-op, and the log said it had worked.
#
# A fixed prefix cannot be made right by changing its default either. The real
# name is built per CLI tool and per instance:
#   mcbd-<cliToolId>-<worktreeId>[-<instance suffix>]
# (BaseCLITool.getSessionName, src/lib/cli-tools/base.ts; the claude path in
# src/lib/session/claude-session.ts is the same shape), so a single prefix can
# address neither a fleet running claude and codex nor a `--instance codex-2`
# worker.
#
# `cliToolId` is a top-level field of the capture payload (CurrentOutputPayload in
# src/lib/session/current-output-builder.ts) — the tool the SERVER resolved for
# this very poll. Deriving from it is what makes the pane we type into provably
# the pane we classified.

# The product's CLI tool ids (CLI_TOOL_IDS, src/lib/cli-tools/types.ts, measured
# 2026-08-01). A plain space-separated string because bash 3.2 has no arrays worth
# the trouble here. A drifted list silently stops resolving the agent of a
# `<worktree-id>@<instance-id>` spec, which puts the *capture* on the wrong pane —
# the same class of silent miss as #1602 itself, so run_tests.sh pins the list.
