#
# Signal priority (each learned from the recipe, see SKILL.md § "根拠").
# The order is the fix for Issue #1522 as much as the anchors are: every branch
# below either injects input or suppresses it, so a branch that fires too early
# damages a healthy session.
#   1. isRunning=false        -> NOT_RUNNING (session_not_running)
#   2. own retry backoff      -> GENERATING  (alive; intervening only queues input)
#   3. prompt (waiting/marker)-> PROMPT      (before GENERATING: an approval prompt
#                                             keeps the `esc to interrupt` footer,
#                                             so the reverse order never approves)
#   4. generation anchor      -> GENERATING  (NOT isGenerating, NOT `Xm Ys`)
#   5. rate-limit banner      -> RATE_LIMIT  (last: see below; then send "a", no sleep)
#   6. otherwise              -> IDLE
