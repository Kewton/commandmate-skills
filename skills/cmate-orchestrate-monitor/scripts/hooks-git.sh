# hooks-git.sh — reference completion hooks for monitor.sh (Issue #1533).
#
# monitor.sh ships `count_commits` / `count_uncommitted` as stubs returning 0 so
# the loop runs standalone. That also makes COMPLETE unreachable, because
# verify-completion.sh reads `commits=0 && uncommitted=0` as the signature of a
# task that was never sent. Source this file to wire both counters to the real
# checkouts:
#
#   monitor.sh --hooks <skill-dir>/scripts/hooks-git.sh <id>...
#   MONITOR_HOOKS=.../hooks-git.sh monitor.sh <id>...
#
# Every git call is checked (CommandMate #1614). A counter that could not be measured
# still answers 0 — that is the value verify-completion.sh reads on the safe
# side, since `commits=0 && uncommitted=0` can only produce NOT_STARTED or
# WORKING, never a false COMPLETE — but it is never a *silent* 0 any more: each
# cause prints one line per worker naming the command that failed, so "git could
# not answer" and "the worker did nothing" are distinguishable in the log.
# Before this, `git ... | wc -l` handed the pipeline's exit code to `wc`, so a
# failing git was indistinguishable from a worker that had written nothing.
#
# Env:
#   MONITOR_HOOKS_BASE       base ref commits are counted against (default origin/develop)
#   MONITOR_HOOKS_REPO       repo whose `git worktree list` is searched (default .)
#   MONITOR_WORKTREE_ROOT    directory holding checkouts named exactly after the
#                            worktree-id; tried before the git search
#   MONITOR_HOOKS_STATE_DIR  where the once-per-worker warning markers are kept
#                            (default: monitor.sh's STATE_DIR when sourced by it)
#
# bash 3.2 compatible and sourced into monitor.sh's shell under `set -u`, so every
# local is prefixed `mh__` and no loop variable is named `path`
# (feedback_zsh_path_loop_var_clobbers_path).

# Warning markers live in a directory, not in a shell variable: monitor.sh calls
# the counters through `$(...)`, i.e. in a subshell, so anything assigned in here

# shell's pid (bash 3.2 does not update it inside `$(...)`), so standalone use is
# stable too; when monitor.sh sources this file its own STATE_DIR is used and the
# markers are removed with it on exit.

# cause does not change between polls. The key is `<worktree-id>.<cause>`, so two
# different failures on one worker are both reported and the same failure on two
# workers is reported for each. If the marker cannot be written the line repeats;
