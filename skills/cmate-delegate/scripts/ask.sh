#!/usr/bin/env bash
# cmate-delegate / ask.sh — send one request to another session, wait for the
# turn to end, and print the reply. One command instead of three.
#
# Usage:
#   ask.sh <worktree-id> <instance-id> "<message>"
#          [--timeout <sec>] [--tail <n>] [--on-prompt agent|human] [--cli <launcher>]
#
# stdout  the squeezed pane transcript of the reply, and nothing else.
# stderr  every diagnostic: send/wait output, the prompt JSON, this script's own
#         complaints. A caller that does `reply=$(ask.sh ...)` must not find this
#         wrapper's voice inside the reply.
# exit    THE EXIT CODE OF `wait`, passed through unchanged.
#           0 turn ended / 10 prompt / 21 not started / 99 target unresolved
#           124 timeout / 1 server down / 2 bad arguments
#           11 upstream fault; id=context-limit on stderr when the reply ended in
#              a context-limit error and the CLI did not say so itself
#         `send` failing before that returns send's code instead; nothing was
#         delegated in that case. When `commandmate ask` exists, its code is
#         returned instead, with one exception below.
#         The one exception: a reply that ENDS in a context-limit error turns an
#         upstream 0 into 11 with id=context-limit. Only 0 is ever rewritten.
#
# The pass-through is the whole point. `commandmate wait ... ; echo done` turns
# every one of those codes into 0, and the caller then reports a timeout as a
# finished delegation. See references/exit-codes.md section 6.
#
# WHAT THIS SCRIPT NEVER DOES: `respond`, `auto-yes`, `interrupt`, `--auto-yes`.
# Answering the other session's prompt is the human's call, not the delegating
# agent's (SKILL.md section 5 and 6). The regression suite greps for these.
#
# bash 3.2 compatible on purpose (macOS ships /bin/bash 3.2.57): no `declare -A`,
# no `mapfile`, no `${var,,}`.
set -u

EXIT_USAGE=2
# UPSTREAM_FAULT. A CLI that knows about context limits returns 11 with
# id=context-limit itself and it passes through untouched; this is the fallback
# for a CLI that does not: the turn "ended" (wait/ask said 0) but the model
# refused the request because the session's context was already full.
EXIT_CONTEXT_LIMIT=11

usage() {
  cat <<'USAGE'
Usage: ask.sh <worktree-id> <instance-id> "<message>" [options]

Options:
  --timeout <sec>          how long to wait for the turn to end (default 1800)
  --tail <n>               lines of squeezed transcript to read back (default 80)
  --on-prompt agent|human  what wait does when the other session asks something.
                           agent (default) returns exit 10 so the prompt can be
                           shown to a human; human blocks until a human answers
                           in the UI and never returns 10.
  --cli <launcher>         commandmate launcher (default: $CM, else commandmate)
  --                       end of options: what follows is the worktree-id, the
                           instance-id and the message, even when the message
                           itself starts with a dash
  -h, --help               this text

Exit code is the exit code of `commandmate wait`, unchanged.
